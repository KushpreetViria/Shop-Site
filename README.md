## Shop-Site
- In progress...
- A shopping site made with an Asp.net API and angular client-side.

#### To run backend API:
- Need .NET Framework installed
- Change directory to \API folder
- Execute `dotnet run` in project 

##### To run client side website:
- Need Node and NPM installed
- Change directory into \client
- Have angular cli: - `npm install @angular/cli`
- Run `npm install` to install dependancies.
- Execute `ng serve --ssl false` in folder. 
	- The ssl certificate is just locally accepted by my machine, so serve without it.

- Based on [this](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-an-app-with-aspnet-core-and-angular-from-scratch/) Udmy course dating website.
